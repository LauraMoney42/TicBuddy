## Primary Persona: Jordan, Age 10

**Name:** Jordan
**Age:** 10 years old
**Grade:** 5th grade
**Location:** Suburban elementary school

---

## Background

Jordan is a bright, energetic 10-year-old who loves Minecraft, soccer, and drawing. About a year ago, Jordan started blinking a lot — more than normal. At first, everyone thought it was just a habit or maybe dry eyes. Jordan's parents took them to an eye doctor, who found nothing wrong.

Over the following months, the blinking got more frequent. Some days it was barely noticeable. Other days, Jordan couldn't stop — blinking hard, over and over, especially during tests or when trying to read. Teachers started noticing. A few kids at school asked "why do you keep doing that?" Jordan didn't have a good answer.

Jordan was recently diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome. The blinking is a motor tic. Sometimes a shoulder shrug appears too, though it comes and goes.

## The Problem

### At School
- The eye blinking interrupts Jordan's focus during reading and math
- Jordan loses their place on the page and has to re-read sentences
- Tests feel harder because the tic gets worse under pressure
- Jordan is embarrassed when classmates notice and ask questions
- One teacher asked Jordan to "stop doing that" in front of the class — Jordan didn't know how to explain it

### At Home
- Jordan's parents are worried and researching everything they can find
- Mom found information about CBIT (Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics) but the nearest therapist is an hour away and has a 3-month waitlist
- Dad wants to help but doesn't know what to do when Jordan gets frustrated
- Jordan feels like nobody really understands what it's like

### Emotionally
- Jordan knows the blinking isn't "on purpose" but still feels embarrassed
- Some days Jordan avoids reading out loud in class to prevent the tic from getting worse
- Jordan wonders if the tics will ever go away or get worse
- Feels alone — doesn't know anyone else with Tourette's

## What Jordan Needs

1. **To feel understood** — not judged, not told to "just stop"
2. **A tool that helps track tics** — so patterns become visible (does it get worse at school? On certain days?)
3. **Strategies to try** — age-appropriate competing responses that Jordan can practice without a therapist in the room
4. **A friendly space to ask questions** — "Why do I tic more when I'm stressed?" in language a 10-year-old can understand
5. **Something that feels like theirs** — not a medical app, but something fun and supportive

## How TicBuddy Helps Jordan

### Onboarding
Jordan opens TicBuddy for the first time. The welcome screen doesn't look like a doctor's office — it's warm, colorful, and says "You're not alone." The onboarding asks Jordan's name, age, and which tics they want to track. It explains what CBIT is in simple terms: *"It's like training your brain to do something else when a tic wants to happen."*

### Tic Tracking
Every day after school, Jordan logs the blinking. Was it a 🟢 easy day, 🟡 medium day, or 🔴 tough day? Over a few weeks, Jordan notices the tic is always worse on Thursdays — the day Jordan has a big spelling test. This is useful information.

### AI Chat
Jordan types: *"Why does my eye keep blinking at school?"*
TicBuddy (powered by Claude) responds in friendly, age-appropriate language — explaining that stress and focus can temporarily increase tics, that this is normal, and offering a competing response to try.

Jordan learns a competing response for the eye blink: a slow, deliberate, gentle blink held for 3 seconds. It doesn't always work, but it helps sometimes.

### For Parents
Jordan's mom finds the "For Adults/Caregivers" section. She reads about:
- What Tourette Syndrome actually is (not what TV says)
- How CBIT works and why it's evidence-based
- How to talk to Jordan's teacher about accommodations
- A link to the Tourette Association's therapist finder

She shows Jordan's teacher the TAA resources. The teacher apologizes and agrees to let Jordan sit in the back during tests if it helps.

## Design Implications

- **Language:** Grade 5 reading level. No medical jargon without explanation.
- **Tone:** Warm, encouraging, never clinical. Like a supportive older friend.
- **Visuals:** Bright but not overstimulating. Soft gradients, friendly icons.
- **Interactions:** Simple, low-friction. A 10-year-old should be able to log a tic in under 10 seconds.
- **Privacy:** Jordan's tic data stays private. No sharing without consent.
- **Dual audience:** The app serves both Jordan AND Jordan's parents — different sections, same compassionate tone.
