# TicBuddy — Clinical Research & CBIT Protocol Reference

## Tourette Syndrome: Key Facts

### Epidemiology
- Affects ~1% of school-age children (1 in 100)
- 3-4x more common in males
- Onset: typically age 5-7, peaks age 10-12
- Tics often improve significantly in late adolescence / early adulthood
- Wax and wane pattern: tics fluctuate in type, frequency, and severity

### Tic Types
**Simple Motor Tics**: Single muscle group
- Eye blinking, eye rolling, head jerking, shoulder shrugging, facial grimacing, nose wrinkling

**Complex Motor Tics**: Coordinated multi-muscle movements
- Touching objects/self, jumping, spinning, echopraxia (imitating others' movements)

**Simple Vocal Tics**: Simple sounds
- Throat clearing, sniffing, grunting, coughing, squeaking, humming

**Complex Vocal Tics**: Words/phrases
- Echolalia (repeating others), palilalia (repeating own words), coprolalia (rare, ~10-15%)

### Premonitory Urge
- 80-90% of TS patients report premonitory urge (PU)
- Described as: uncomfortable, tension, pressure, "like needing to sneeze"
- Relieved temporarily by performing the tic
- KEY for CBIT: learning to notice PU before tic fires is the foundation of competing response training
- Younger children (under 10) often have less PU awareness — adapt accordingly

### Common Co-occurring Conditions
- ADHD: 50-60%
- OCD: 20-60%
- Anxiety: 30-40%
- Learning disabilities: 20-30%

### What Makes Tics Worse
- Stress and anxiety (most common)
- Excitement (positive events too)
- Fatigue/poor sleep
- Illness/fever
- Excessive screen time
- Social situations with perceived judgment
- Boredom (surprisingly)
- Anticipating tics (monitoring effect)

### What Helps
- Relaxation and calm
- Focused activity (flow state)
- Physical exercise
- Acceptance-based mindset
- Understanding from family/teachers
- CBIT (strongest behavioral evidence)

## CBIT Protocol: Clinical Foundation

### What is CBIT?
Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) is a first-line behavioral treatment for TS with Level 1 evidence.

**Key RCT (JAMA 2010, Woods et al.):**
- 52.5% meaningful improvement (vs 18.5% control)
- Effects maintained at 6-month follow-up
- Works for ages 9+ (adapted for younger)
- 8 sessions over 10 weeks in clinical setting

### Core CBIT Components

#### 1. Psychoeducation
- Explain TS in non-stigmatizing terms
- Explain CBIT rationale (neuroplasticity)
- Set realistic expectations

#### 2. Awareness Training (Week 1-2 in TicBuddy)
**Goal**: Accurately describe and identify tics + recognize PU

**Steps**:
1. Tic Description — detailed behavioral description of each tic
2. Self-monitoring — learn to notice tic AS it happens (not after)
3. Antecedent awareness — notice what precedes tics (situations, feelings, PU)
4. Early detection — catch tic in first movement

**Key principle**: Increased awareness may temporarily increase tic frequency. NORMALIZE this.

#### 3. Competing Response (CR) Training (Week 3+ in TicBuddy)
**What makes a good competing response**:
1. Physically incompatible with the tic (can't do both at once)
2. Can be maintained for ~1 minute
3. Socially inconspicuous (no one should notice)
4. Not uncomfortable or painful

**CR by Tic Type**:

| Tic | Competing Response |
|-----|-------------------|
| Eye blink | Slow controlled blink + sustained eye opening |
| Head jerk | Isometric neck tension (no movement, slight downward chin tuck) |
| Shoulder shrug | Shoulder depression (push shoulders firmly down) |
| Facial grimace | Relaxed neutral face, lip press |
| Arm jerk | Tense arm firmly against body |
| Throat clearing | Slow nasal breathing, mouth closed, throat relaxed |
| Sniffing | Controlled slow nasal exhale, then regular nasal breathing |
| Grunting | Slow rhythmic nasal breathing, mouth closed |

**Universal CRs** (work for most tics):
- Slow diaphragmatic breathing (most versatile)
- Isometric tension in opposing muscle

**CR Training Process**:
1. Identify best CR for patient's most bothersome tic
2. Practice CR when NOT experiencing tic urge
3. Practice CR WHEN experiencing tic urge
4. Use CR at first sign of PU or early tic movement
5. Hold CR for 1 full minute or until urge passes (whichever is longer)

#### 4. Function-Based Assessment
Identify situations where tics are consistently worse:
- Social settings with perceived judgment → add relaxation/acceptance
- Homework/concentration tasks → examine ADHD overlap
- Transitions → prepare strategies

#### 5. Relaxation Training (Week 9+ in TicBuddy)
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Applied relaxation (cue-controlled)

#### 6. Social Support Component
- Parents learn to notice and praise CR use
- Teachers informed (optional)
- Family reduces inadvertent tic reinforcement

## Neuroplasticity: Kid-Friendly Framework

### The Science (simplified for app content)
- Tics involve basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits
- Repeated tic → well-worn neural pathway (like a rut in mud)
- CBIT creates competing pathway → brain learns new route
- Takes 8-12 weeks for pathways to consolidate
- Changes visible on fMRI after CBIT

### Kid-Friendly Metaphors
1. **Play-Doh Brain**: "Your brain is like Play-Doh. Every time you practice, it changes shape!"
2. **Train Tracks**: "Tics are like trains on old tracks. We're building NEW tracks."
3. **Muscle Memory**: "Remember learning to ride a bike? CBIT works the same way."
4. **Video Game Analogy**: "Every Power Move you do is XP — you're leveling up your brain!"
5. **Superpower Framing**: "Catching a tic before it happens is literally a superpower."

## Language Guidelines for App

### Terms to USE
| Clinical Term | Kid-Friendly App Term |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Premonitory urge | "The feeling before" / "Signal feeling" |
| Competing response | "Power Move" / "Redirect" |
| CBIT | "Brain Training" |
| Tic | "Tic" (they already know this term) |
| Awareness training | "Detective Mode" / "Notice Phase" |
| Treatment | "Adventure" / "Journey" |
| Baseline | "Your starting point" |

### Communication Principles
1. **Never shame** — tics are not the user's fault, never frame as "controlling" or "stopping"
2. **Celebrate noticing** — catching = winning, even when no redirect happens
3. **Normalize wax/wane** — "Some days are harder. That's TS, not you."
4. **Frame progress correctly** — success = consistent practice, not tic elimination
5. **Intrinsic motivation** — tie progress to user's own goals (sports, social, school)

## Claude API System Prompt Design Notes

### Tone Guidelines by Age
- Under 8: Very simple words, max 2 sentences, lots of emojis, game language
- 8-11: Simple friendly language, 3-4 sentences, emojis ok, achievement framing
- 12-14: Friendly but slightly more mature, 4-5 sentences, less emoji dependency
- 15+: Peer-like tone, 5-6 sentences, clinical terms OK if explained

### When to Log a Tic (from conversation)
If user says: "I just blinked", "I had a tic", "throat thing happened", "did it again"
→ Extract: type (motor/vocal), description, whether caught, whether redirected
→ Log automatically + confirm with praise

### Safety Guidelines for AI
- NEVER diagnose or suggest diagnosis
- NEVER recommend stopping medication
- NEVER give medical advice
- DO suggest consulting a doctor/therapist for medical questions
- DO provide encouragement for difficult emotional moments
- IF user expresses distress/hopelessness → provide supportive response + suggest talking to trusted adult
